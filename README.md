/datapipe - A bunch of Data Pipeline end to end execution scripts, including descriptions and examples

More to come, hopefully!

 A data pipeline script is made up of a few sections:
 1. Set the common variables (lots of boilerplate)
 2. Define a bunch of config files that use these variables
 3. Tell Azure to Initialise all the infrastructure you'll need, including:
	- 
	- You could potentially do this in parallel
 4. Grab the details of the infrastructure, and pass the details to Data Factory. Details include:
	- Storage linked service file, containing:
		-  
	- Usernames and passwords
